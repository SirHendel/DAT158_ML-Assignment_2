## DAT158_ML-Assignment_2

Requirements:

You should work in groups of 2-4 students.

You are expected to adhere to the description of the ML lifecycle presented in ML module 3: Playing the whole game â€“ Practical ML and to address the various challenges for practical machine learning-based projects described therein.

You must write a short report using the following template: [NorwegianNorwegian herunterladen], [EnglishEnglish herunterladen].
I recommend that you start writing the report as soon as possible and then update it after you've conducted some hands-on experiments.
A tip: to co-write the report, use Office365 or upload the template to Google Docs.

You have to create and use a GitHub repository for your project. It has to contain all the code and documentation needed to understand what you did and how. 
It must also contain your written report.
You will submit a link to this repository to Canvas before the deadline. 
If the repository is private, you must add me (user alu042) as a collaborator before submitting.

The code and notebooks must be well-documented and, of course, not plagiarized.
If you incorporate other people's code in your solutions, make sure that you fully understand what the code does and that you cite the source.

You have to deploy your system.

It has to be easy for others to reproduce your results.

You must create a short video demonstrating how one can interact with your deployed model or, alternatively and even better, make it available by hosting it online.
